MTA_Homework
============

Refactoring in-class coding of a small-scale MTA simulation. Using Underscore.js


Duplicated this individual directory (homework) to my own repo to isolate my homework process.
Moving on to javascript has been difficult for me this past week (7.21 - 7.26) and I wanted to
isolate this repository on my own system to avoid merge conflicts and hold onto this assignment.
